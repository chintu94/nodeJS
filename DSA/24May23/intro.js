Data Structure is a way to organize data so that it can be used efficiently.
Algorithms are the steps or process of organizing the data.

Two types of Data Structure :-
1) Primitive Data Structure
  a) Integer
  b) Character
  c) Float
  d) Pointer

2) Non-primitive Data Structure
  a) Array
  b) Lists
    * Linear List
      # Stacks
      # Queues
    * Non-Linear List
      # Graphs
      # Trees
  c) Files


Operations of Data Structure
- Traversal
