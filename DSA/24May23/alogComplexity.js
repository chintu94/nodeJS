/**

Algorithm are the steos taken to solve a problem.
Algorithm complexity is determined based on the time and space consumption any algorithm.

Time Complexity is the number of steps needed to solve a problem.
Space Complexity is the amount of space needed to solve a problem. It includes auxiliary space and input space.

Big O notation is a standard denotion for an algorithm's complexity.


Asymptotic analysis is used to find the optimal algorithm to solve a given problem.

Time complexity directly depends on the inputs (if we have an array of 100 elements then those will be 100 inputs)

So we can also say that time complexity is dependent on the loops we have in an algorithm.
